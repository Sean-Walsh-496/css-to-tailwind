-   When converting all single quotes to double quotes, any single quotes the user put in their tag
    names also get converted. For example: <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" name = "don't delete me"></div>.
    Here, the name breaks the code because the "don't delete me" becomes "don"t delete me"

-   None of your names are allowed to have spaces in them because the spaces are all eventually removed from the
    tags. In that previous example, the name would become "dontdeleteme"
